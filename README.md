# About the Project

This project is a CV maker built with the React framework.

Users can input their personal information (name, email, and phone number), their education, and work experience. They can add, delete, and edit their entries with ease via the "Add" buttons and the "Edit" (pencil) and "Delete" (trash can) icons. Click on the "Submit" button to save the form information. If you do not wish to save the current form information and want to revert back, click on the "Cancel" button.

At any time on the edit page, the user can click the "Preview" button to see a CV page with their included information. However, any unsaved form changes/additions will be lost, so make sure to press the "Submit" button for any desired entries.

On the preview page, if the user wants to go back and make changes, they can click on any of the sections (the personal info section, the "Education" and "Work Experience" headers, and the school/company entries) on the page to edit the corresponding section.

This app does not collect or store personal information anywhere. If the user refreshes the page, all of the information they have included will be removed.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
